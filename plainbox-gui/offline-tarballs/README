The contents of this directory allow preparation of offline tarballs for
driver testing.

An offline tarball contains all needed deb package dependencies to install
driver-testing into a clean Ubuntu system. Tarballs need to be built for each
specific architecture, flavor and release combination since dependencies
are tailor-suited for each.


To build a tarball
==================

- Get a copy of lp:dpkg_offline
- Get the installer ISO for the desired target.
- Ensure the PPAs and extra files make sense for your installation.
  The config files as included should work out-of-the-box for driver-testing.
- Call dpkg_offline specifying the ppas file, the extras file, target ISO
  and set of seed packages like so:

/path/to/dpkg_offline  /path/to/ubuntu-13.04-desktop-i386.iso \
"driver-testing other-package-maybe" -r ppas.txt  -e extras.txt

- Wait a few minutes. If successful, a tarball will be left in the current
  directory. If a failure occurs, on-screen messages will point you to log files
  where you can get more details about what failed. Temporary directories
  will not be cleaned up in case of a failure so you can do a post-mortem.


To install a tarball
====================

1 - Copy to the target system
2 - Uncompress the tarball. It will create a directory with a long name.
3 - Switch to that directory, then either double-click the
    "Canonical Driver Testing" icon or execute the "start_testing.sh" script.
4 - If required, enter the password to set up local package repositories and
    install packages.
5 - The driver testing utility will be automatically launched once the install
    is complete.


To perform further testing
==========================

- Simply look for the "driver testing" application using the Ubuntu dash,
  or repeat step 3 above (it will not ask for the password or install packages
  again).
