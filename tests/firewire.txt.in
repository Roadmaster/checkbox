 Firewire HDD verification procedure:
 1.- Plug a Firewire HDD into the computer
 2.- A window should be opened asking which action should be performed (open folder, photo manager, etc).
 3.- Copy some files from the internal/firewire HDD to the firewire/internal HDD
 .
 Do the copy operations work as expected?
